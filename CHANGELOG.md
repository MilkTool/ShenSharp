## [0.8.0.0] - 2017-03-15

### Added
- `Shen.Pack` which repacks assemblies together and builds NuGet package.
- `Obj of obj` as a case of `Value`.
- CLR interop functions:
  - `clr.alias` - assign alias to full CLR class name.
  - `clr.new` - creating CLR objects, including generics: `new Class(x)`.
  - `clr.unbox` - gets Kλ values from CLR primitve values.
  - `clr.null`, `clr.bool`, `clr.int`, `clr.decimal`, `clr.string` - creating primitive values from Kλ values.
  - `clr.get`, `clr.set` - get/set instance properties on objects: `dateTime.Hour`.
  - `clr.get-static`, `clr.set-static` - get/set properties on classes: `DateTime.Now`.
  - `clr.get-index`, `clr.set-index` - accessing indexer properties: `obj[x]`.
  - `clr.invoke`, `clr.invoke-static` - invoking methods: `obj.Method(x)`.
- `shensharp.globals`: direct access to the port's runtime.
- `--help` option to Shen.Repl.
- Conversion optimization to `Kl.Make` for functions.

### Changed
- Interpreted functions now use captured scope inlining instead of carrying around `Map` of locals.
- Moved helper extension methods from code generated in `Kl.Make` to `Shen.Api`.
- Simplified project logo by removing sharp symbol.

### Fixed
- Top-level REPL function re-named back from `shen.shen` to `shen`.
- Fixed use of `ILRepack`.

### Changed
- Shen version updated to 19.3.1.
- Top-level REPL function re-named from `shen.shen` to `shen`.
